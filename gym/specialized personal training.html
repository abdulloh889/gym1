            <h2>Osteoporosis</h2>
            <p>
              Osteoporosis literally means “porous bone”, and refers to reduced
              bone density or the loss of bone tissue. Regular exercise is
              recommended for people with osteoporosis, as it can help
              strengthen bone density, improve balance, and prevent
              osteoporosis-related fractures.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our specialized osteoporosis training program you will gain a
              better understanding of symptoms and causes, as well as healthy
              habits and exercises to improve bone strength, and leave your body
              feeling healthy, strong, and confident.

            <p>
              Prehab training is like bulletproofing your body. We equip your
              body with mobility and strength training so you can have the best
              chance at defending yourself against injuries. If an injury
              occurs, your prehabilitative training will help lessen the
              severity, and recovery time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pre and post-natal fitness requires specialized knowledge to
              ensure the safety of mom and baby. That’s why we created the
              specialized pre and post-natal training program to work with
              moms-to-be and new moms, to help you safely, and effectively
              continue your health and fitness journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our specialized pre and post-natal fitness training will educate
              you on best practices for exercise, nutrition, and recovery, for
              each stage of pregnancy, as well as after your baby is born.
