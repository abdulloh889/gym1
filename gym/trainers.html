              The most courageous thing I've done was immigrate to Canada in
              2006 without knowing anybody in Toronto. I've been working in the
              fitness industry since, as a personal trainer and later on as a
              small studio owner. My physiotherapy degree from Bulgaria, and the
              additional courses I've taken in Canada have helped me coach
              numerous clients towards improving their health and fitness.

              As someone who wasn't the least bit athletic growing up, I love
              working with people who are new to the gym and may be intimidated.
              Showing my clients that they're capable of more than they ever
              thought possible and that being active brings benefits to every
              aspect of their lives are the most rewarding parts of my job.

              To Aran, personal training and fitness goes beyond moving your
              body, and is about defining what success means to you. Growing up
              immersed in sports, namely soccer and martial arts, Aran gained an
              appreciation for what progress looks like – something that looks
              different for everyone.

              If there's one thing that inspires Natalee it's the feeling of
              hitting personal goals and records. In her early twenties, Natalee
              turned to fitness as a way to create a positive mindset, build
              confidence, and find happiness in her health and body. As someone
              who had many positive mentors throughout her fitness journey,
              Natalee hopes to do the same for others and pay forward what has
              been given to her.

              I never sugarcoat things and always tell my clients what I expect
              from them and I ask the same from them. I also believe that honest
              two-way communication is very important in the trainer-client
              relationship. I implement and stay up to date with current
              research and training modalities. I would classify myself as a
              specialized generalist trainer.
